- Numbers: lit, +, *, ==, select
- Tuples: (...) types and values, Unit, unpack
- Macros: lit (diffs with ph), e t fix, @
- Identifiers: $x =, $T =, x, T
- type operator
- Notes:
  - *: zero or more of
  - epsilon: zero of nothing
  - args come from stack not syntax

- The webassembly paper didn't ever specify step judgement
- for e*, redex moves from left to right until all \val
- can step within tuples
- tuples of values are values

- Lexical scope
- assingment assigns to current scope
- identifier
- \sigma(-1)

- trivially defined
- Kronecker Delta
- select is not short-circuit

- operations involving types so we made types step
- val and step equivalent to prim and tstep
- same left-to-right behavior
- equal precedence with e expressions
- tuple types are just tuples of types so same behavior

- they can use the same store because names don't collide
- macros step to macro values by capturing lexically scoped variables
